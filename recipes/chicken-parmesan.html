        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p><strong>Chicken parmigiana</strong>, or <strong>chicken parmesan</strong>, is a dish that consists of breaded chicken breast covered in tomato sauce and mozzarella, parmesan, or provolone cheese. A quantity of ham or bacon is sometimes added. The dish originated from 20th-century Italian diaspora.</p>
        <p><strong>Chicken Parmesan</strong> is no doubt the most popular non-pasta dish in Italian-American style restaurants. And while this delicious meal may seem fancy, it's actually pretty easy to make at home.</p>    
    
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/4 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil for frying</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons prepared tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon fresh mozzarella</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons grated provolone cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon olive oil</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/2-inch. Season chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside.</li>
            <li>Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl, set aside.</li>
            <li>Place flour in a sifter or strainer; sprinkle over chicken breasts, evenly coating both sides.</li>
            <li>Dip a flour-coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer breast to the bread crumb mixture, pressing crumbs into both sides. Repeat for each breast. Let chicken rest for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat 1/2 inch olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. Cook chicken in the hot oil until golden, about 2 minutes per side. The chicken will finish cooking in the oven.</li>
            <li>Heat 1/2 inch olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. Cook chicken in the hot oil until golden, about 2 minutes per side. The chicken will finish cooking in the oven.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly and chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        </ol>
